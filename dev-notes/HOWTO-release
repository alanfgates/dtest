1. Set the pom versions from SNAPSHOT to the version you plan to release.
  mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=x.y.z -DgenerateBackupPoms=false

2. Run the build, make sure all is good.
  mvn clean install
  git commit -a

3. Run on a build machine with a real workload (like Hive or Ozone) and make sure it works.

4. Tag the release
  git tag -a release-x.y.z -m "DTest x.y.z release"

5. Advance the pom versions to the next version and add SNAPSHOT
   (Note, next version shown here as y+1, but it could be x or z +1 as well.)
  mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=x.y+1.z-SNAPSHOT -DgenerateBackupPoms=false
  git commit -a

6. Push all this to github
  git push master afg
